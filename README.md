## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   CSS

### Continued development

The use of rem and em still somewhat elude me, so in future projects I will be trying to hammer home when to use them and why.

### Useful resources

-   [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/) - I am still new to media queries so this site was great at pointing me in the right direction.
